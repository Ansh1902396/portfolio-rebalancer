# Dynamic Rebalancing Threshold Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the dynamic rebalancing threshold system that automatically adjusts based on market volatility conditions, replacing the fixed threshold approach previously used in the portfolio rebalancer.

## Business Rationale

### Problem Statement
The original system used a fixed `rebalance_threshold` (e.g., 25%) stored in the Portfolio account. All strategies in the bottom 25% percentile would be marked for capital extraction regardless of market conditions. This approach had limitations:

- **Market Insensitivity**: During stable periods (low volatility), the system was too conservative, missing optimization opportunities
- **Risk Exposure**: During volatile periods, the system was too aggressive, potentially causing excessive trading costs and market timing risks
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: No consideration of current market conditions in rebalancing decisions

### Solution
Dynamic threshold calculation based on average volatility across all active strategies in the portfolio:

```
Dynamic Threshold = Base Threshold + Volatility Adjustment

Where:
- Base Threshold = 15%
- Volatility Adjustment = (Average Strategy Volatility / 100) × 20%
- Final Range = 10% minimum, 40% maximum
```

### Business Benefits
- **Market Responsive**: More aggressive during stable periods, conservative during volatile periods
- **Risk Management**: Reduces excessive trading during high volatility
- **Optimization**: Captures more opportunities during low volatility periods
- **Automated**: No manual intervention required for threshold adjustments

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions

#### 1. `calculate_average_volatility(strategies: &[StrategyData]) -> Result<u32>`

Calculates the average volatility across all active strategies.

**Parameters:**
- `strategies`: Array of StrategyData containing volatility scores

**Returns:**
- `Result<u32>`: Average volatility as percentage (0-100)

**Algorithm:**
1. Validates strategies array is not empty
2. Converts volatility_score (0-10000) to percentage (0-100)
3. Calculates arithmetic mean with overflow protection
4. Bounds checking to ensure result ≤ 100%

**Safety Features:**
- Division by zero protection
- Integer overflow checks using `checked_add()` and `checked_div()`
- Empty array validation

#### 2. `calculate_dynamic_threshold(strategies: &[StrategyData]) -> Result<u8>`

Calculates the dynamic threshold based on average volatility.

**Parameters:**
- `strategies`: Array of StrategyData for threshold calculation

**Returns:**
- `Result<u8>`: Dynamic threshold percentage (10-40)

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate average volatility using `calculate_average_volatility()`
2. Apply formula: `15% + (avg_volatility / 100) × 20%`
3. Enforce bounds: minimum 10%, maximum 40%

**Example Calculations:**
- Low volatility (20%): 15% + (20/100 × 20%) = 19% threshold
- Medium volatility (50%): 15% + (50/100 × 20%) = 25% threshold
- High volatility (80%): 15% + (80/100 × 20%) = 31% threshold

### Integration Points

#### 1. Modified `calculate_percentile_rankings()`

**Key Changes:**
- Calculates dynamic threshold at the beginning of the function
- Updates all StrategyData entries with the dynamic threshold
- Uses dynamic threshold for underperformer identification
- Enhanced logging to show dynamic threshold value

#### 2. Updated `execute_batch_ranking()`

**Key Changes:**
- Removes dependency on fixed portfolio threshold
- Calculates dynamic threshold through the ranking process
- Uses dynamic threshold for rebalancing candidate identification
- Improved logging with threshold information

#### 3. Modified `process_all_strategies_with_ranking()`

**Key Changes:**
- Eliminates hardcoded portfolio threshold dependency
- Integrates dynamic threshold calculation
- Updates rebalancing candidate logic to use dynamic values

### Mathematical Safety

#### Overflow Protection
All arithmetic operations use checked methods:
```rust
// Safe addition
total_volatility = total_volatility
    .checked_add(volatility_pct as u64)
    .ok_or(RebalancerError::MathOverflow)?;

// Safe division
let average_volatility = total_volatility
    .checked_div(count)
    .ok_or(RebalancerError::DivisionByZero)?;
```

#### Bounds Enforcement
- Volatility percentages capped at 100%
- Dynamic threshold bounded between 10% and 40%
- Division by zero prevention for empty strategy arrays

#### Edge Case Handling
- **Empty Strategy Array**: Returns `InsufficientStrategies` error
- **Zero Volatility**: Handled gracefully, results in base threshold (15%)
- **Single Strategy**: Calculates threshold normally, no special underperformer logic
- **Maximum Volatility**: Properly bounded to 40% maximum threshold

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

#### 1. `test_calculate_average_volatility()`
Tests volatility calculation with various scenarios:
- Multiple strategies with different volatility levels
- Validates arithmetic mean calculation
- Verifies result is within expected bounds

#### 2. `test_calculate_dynamic_threshold()`
Tests threshold calculation:
- Low volatility scenario (20% → 19% threshold)
- High volatility scenario (80% → 31% threshold)
- Extreme volatility (100% → 35% threshold, within bounds)

#### 3. `test_dynamic_threshold_bounds()`
Validates boundary conditions:
- Minimum threshold enforcement (never below 10%)
- Maximum threshold enforcement (never above 40%)
- Zero volatility handling

#### 4. `test_percentile_ranking_with_dynamic_threshold()`
Integration test for ranking with dynamic thresholds:
- Verifies dynamic threshold calculation and application

## Examples

### Low Volatility Market (Stable Conditions)
```
Strategies: [10%, 15%, 25%] volatility
Average Volatility: 16.67%
Dynamic Threshold: 15% + (16.67/100 × 20%) = 18.33% → 18%
Result: More aggressive rebalancing (lower threshold)
```

### High Volatility Market (Turbulent Conditions)
```
Strategies: [60%, 80%, 90%] volatility
Average Volatility: 76.67%
Dynamic Threshold: 15% + (76.67/100 × 20%) = 30.33% → 30%
Result: More conservative rebalancing (higher threshold)
```

### Extreme Cases
```
Zero Volatility: 15% + (0/100 × 20%) = 15%
Maximum Volatility: 15% + (100/100 × 20%) = 35% (within 40% cap)
```
